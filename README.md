# Andersen Algorithm to price a receiver Bermudean swaption - Advanced Derivatives (FIN-503)
In this project we implement the Andersen Algorithm to price a receiver Bermudean swaption as an assignment for the course Andanced Derivatives of the Master in Financial Engineering at EPFL. The following files are:

- `Advanced Derivatives Assignment 11.ipynb` which contains the code with the implementations of the algorithm.

- `Project_report_Advanced_Derivatives.pdf` which is the report of this project with a detailed description of the Andersen Algorithm and of its implementation.
